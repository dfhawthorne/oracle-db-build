# oracle-db-build

Consolidated repository of playbooks for installing various Oracle RDBMs software versions.

## Overview

I have database software deployment, patching, and database creation scripts strewn across multiple
repositories:

- [ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c)
- [demos](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos)

Because I am now starting to get involved with [HammerDB](https://www.hammerdb.com) development, I
did not want to put the DB build scripts into my forked repository,
[HammerDB](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/HammerDB).

## Wiki

There are instructions on how to use this code on the associated [wiki](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/oracle-db-build/wiki)
page.

## Software Licence

MIT because it is so simple.
