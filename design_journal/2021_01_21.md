# 2021-01-21: Creation of a separate respository

## Overview

In order to support my work with HammerDB, I will have to deploy databases with
differing versions of Oracle RDBMS software.

* [Design Challenges](#design-challenges)
  * [Multiple Oracle Versions](#multiple-oracle-versions)
  * [Non-RAC Homes Only](#non-rac-homes-only)

# Rationale

I have database software deployment, patching, and database creation scripts strewn across multiple repositories:

- [ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c)
- [demos](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/demos)

Because I am now starting to get involved with [HammerDB](https://www.hammerdb.com)
development, I did not want to put the DB build scripts into my forked
repository,
[HammerDB](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/HammerDB).

# Design Challenges

## Multiple Oracle Versions

My initial design option is to encode the version of the Oracle RDBMS software
through inventory groups:

- `ALL` for all common variables
- `12CR1` for Oracle RDBMS 12.1
- `12CR2` for Oracle RDBMS 12.2
- `18C` for Oracle RDBMS 18C
- `19C` for Oracle RDBMS 19C
- `21C` for Oracle RDBMS 21C

There will be a single patch level for each version. This means that there is
also a single OPatch version for each software release.

## Non-RAC Homes Only

This version of the repository will only RDBMS homes without Grid Infrastructure.
