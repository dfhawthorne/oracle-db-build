configuration.

# Rationale

The installation of Oracle 18C XE is relatively straight forward. There is no
patching needed.

# Design Options

## Use Ansible Groups

The main script, `sites.yml`, now includes one of the following based on the
group name the current host belongs (actually the first one in a list if the
host belongs to more than one (1) group):

- `install_V19C_database.yml`
- `install_XE_database.yml`

### Ansible Group Names

An Ansible group name, like `19C`, gives the following error messages:
```
Not replacing invalid character(s) "{'1'}" in group name (19C)
[WARNING]: Invalid characters were found in group names but not replaced, use
-vvvv to see details
```

I now use `V19C` to get around this problem.
