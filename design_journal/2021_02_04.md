# Issues Fixed

## Issue - #5 XE: Using discovered Python interpreter

Resolved issue #5 ("XE: Using discovered Python interpreter") by setting
`ansible_python_interpreter` in the host variable file for XE.

## Issue - #10 XE: Firewall needs to be reloaded after rule changes

Resolved "XE: Firewall needs to be reloaded after rule changes #10" by:
- Split firewall rules between Oracle listener and Enterprise Manager Express
  - Firewall rules for Oracle listener moved to `sites.yml` because these rules
    are common to all Oracle database builds.
  - Firewall rules for Enterprise Manager Express are left in
    `install_XE_database.yml` because this feature is part of the XE database.
- Added handler to reload firewall rules to `sites.yml`.

# Added Python Version Dependency

Because of the issue described in
"[pip install on Python 2 fails with SyntaxError: sys.stderr.write(f"ERROR: {exc}") #9500](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/9500)",
I had to add code to deploy a downgraded version of PIP2. This code only runs
if the version of Python used is 2.

As a counterpart to this, I added untested code for Python3 on OL7 based on
code I used in
[install_modules.yml](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c/blob/version_2/roles/common/tasks/install_modules.yml)
of my [ansible-ocm12c](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/ansible-ocm12c)
project.
