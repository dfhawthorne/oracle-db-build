## Operating System Support Restrictions

I have restricted the playbook to only run on Oracle Linux (OL) 7 systems, or
higher. The testing has only been done for OL 8 systems.

"[Operating System Checklist for Oracle Database Installation on Linux](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/ladbi/operating-system-checklist-for-oracle-database-installation-on-linux.html#GUID-E5C0A90E-7750-45D9-A8BC-C7319ED934F0)" says that the "Linux x86-64 operating system requirements" are:

> The following Linux x86-64 kernels are supported:
> 
> - Oracle Linux 8.1 with the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 6: 5.4.17-2011.0.7.el8uek.x86_64 or later
> - Oracle Linux 8 with the Red Hat Compatible kernel: 4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64 or later
> 
> - Oracle Linux 7.4 with the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 4: 4.1.12-124.19.2.el7uek.x86_64 or later
> - Oracle Linux 7.4 with the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 5: 4.14.35-1818.1.6.el7uek.x86_64 or later
> - Oracle Linux 7.7 with the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel 6: 5.4.17-2011.4.4.el7uek.x86_64 or later
> - Oracle Linux 7.5 with the Red Hat Compatible Kernel: 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64 or later
> 
> - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8: 4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64 or later
> 
> - Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5: 3.10.0-862.11.6.el7.x86_64 or later
> 
> - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: 4.12.14-23-default or later
> 
> - SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3: 4.4.162-94.72-default or later
> 
> Review the system requirements section for a list of minimum package requirements.

As a matter of expediency, I am not going to cater for all of these combinations.
I am going to make the assumption that my simple testing of the major version is
sufficient to cater for these cases.
