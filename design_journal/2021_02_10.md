# 2021-02-10: Minor Revisions to 19C EE Installation

## Overview

I removed potential naming conflicts between RDBMS and Oracle GoldenGate (OGG)
patching, and force recompilation after RDBMS patching.

# Patching Scripts

## Remove Naming Conflicts

While installing Oracle GoldenGate (OGG), I used a script called `apply_patch.sh`
to apply patches to OGG. This name is very close to the one I use to patch the
RDBMS home, `apply_patches.sh`.

To reduce the name confusion on servers that have both RDBMS and OGG installed,
I will rename these scripts to:

1. `apply_rdbms_patches.sh` (applies two (2) patches)
1. `apply_ogg_patch.sh` (applies one (1) patch)

## Add Patch Number as Parameter

In my coding for OGG, I now pass the patch number as a parameter, and use that
to validate the patch directory.

However, this will not work for patching RDBMS because there are two (2) patches
that jave to be applied in a particular order.

# Recompilation Incomplete

In issue #13 ("GOLDENGATE: Recompilation Incomplete after Patching"), there is a
message:
```
Automatic recompilation incomplete; run utlrp.sql to revalidate.
  PDBs: CDB$ROOT
```

The simplest solution is to always recompile the root container (`CDB$ROOT`)
after patching. The change is made to `templates/apply_rdbms_patches.sh.j2`.

There is a remaining problem in that the above message remains in the output
from the patching.
