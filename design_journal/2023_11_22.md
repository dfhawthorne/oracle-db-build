# 2023-11-22: Separation of Tasks from SITES.YML

## Overview

With the implementation of the `orchestration` GIT repository, all of the tasks from the `sites.yml` have been moved into a separate file, `install_oracle_rdbms.yml`.

## Table of Contents

* [Separate Tasks File](#separate-tasks-file)
* [Moved Variables from Inventory to VARS Directory](#moved-variables-from-inventory-to-vars-directory)
* [Installation of Oracle RDBMS 19C](#installation-of-oracle-rdbms-19c)

## Separate Tasks File

The tasks from `sites.yml` were put into a new file called `install_oracle_rdbms.yml` so that other playbooks can be constructed based on a subset of hosts. These playbooks can then be included by playbooks in other repositories, such as `orchestration`.

The `sites.yml` playbook now merely has the hosts, `all`, and includes all tasks from `install_oracle_rdbms.yml`.

A new playbook, `install_oracle_on_goldengate.yml`, has the same structure as `sites.yml` except that the hosts are restricted to `goldengate`.

## Moved Variables from Inventory to VARS Directory

The original idea of using the group name to segregate variables by Oracle RDBMS version turned out to a bad idea when I tried to use orchestration across multiple repositories. The main reason is that the inventory from the `orchestration` is used instead of the inventory from this repository.

The changes made were:

| Inventory Group Var File Name | VARS File Name    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `V19C.yml`                    | `V19C.yml`        |
| `XE.yml`                      | `XE.yml`          |
| `all.yml`                     | `global_vars.yml` |

## Installation of Oracle RDBMS 19C

Installation of Oracle RDBMS is marked as FAILED when the string, '[FATAL]', is found in the error output.
