# 2023-12-02: Script to Repair RDBMS

I created scripts called, `templates/repair_rdbms.sh.j2` and `template/repair_dbms.sql.j2`, to do:

1. Apply datapatch to DB, if required.
1. Fix a known issue with [PLS-00201: identifier DBMS_AQ_SUB.GET_SUB_CURSOR must be declared (Doc ID REM 2681183.1)](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=2681183.1).
1. Fix a known issue with [KUPW$WORKER or KUPU$UTILITIES_INT Invalid after Upgrade (Doc ID 2691905.1)](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=2691905.1).

I chose a template, rather than a file, because of the number of parameters that needed to be passed. The extra complexity of validating passed parameters was not considered to be worthwhile for a script that will be used in an Ansible playbook.
