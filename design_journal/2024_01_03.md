## Issues Fixed

I did a manual fix of issue #17 (OJVM Apply Failed). However, the fix was incomplete, and issue #18 (Corrupt Inventory) was raised. I had to manually rollback RDBMS patch 35643107.

Since these issues appear to be unique, I did not update the Ansible playbook to accomodate these issues.

## Installation of Perl

The installation of Perl is done as part of RDBMS 19C installation because issue #17 (OJVM Apply Failed) appears to be 19C specific.
