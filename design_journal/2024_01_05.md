# 2024-01-05: Improved Patch Detection

## Summary

The testing of whether patches have been applied has been moved into the patching script out from the playbook.

## Table of Contents

* [install_V19C_database.yml](#install_v19c_databaseyml)
* [apply_rdbms_patches.sh.j2](#apply_rdbms_patchesshj2)
* [start_db_inst.py.j2](#start_db_instpyj2)

## install_V19C_database.yml

Due to issue #22 (OCT23 PSU Corrupt Files Found for 35643107), I had to replace the use of the Opatch utility, `verify`, with `lsinventory`.

This had the unintended effect of simplifying the playbook, `install_V19C_database.yml`. Now there is a single invocation of `opatch lsinventory` for both combo and individual patches, instead of three (3) different invocations of `opatch verify`.

My first coding of the conditionals for deciding to do patching gave rise to warnings that are described in issue #23 (conditional statements should not include jinja2 templating delimiters).

## apply_rdbms_patches.sh.j2

The testing for whether the patches had been applied was then moved into the `templates/apply_rdbms_patches.sh.j2` script out of `install_V19C_database.yml`.

I also increased the testing for whether:

1. PMON is running
1. Oracle listener is running

## start_db_inst.py.j2

"ORA-01099 Shutdown in progress" (issue #24) was resolved by trying to wait for PMON to shutdown after twenty (20) tries at fifteen (15) second intervals.
