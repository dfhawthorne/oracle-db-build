# 2024-01-07: Patch OCW to 19.21

## Summary

The playbooks were updated to accomodate OCW patching. This caused a redesign of patching.

## Issues

The issues affected are:

* #26 Apply OCT23 PSU to OCW in Oracle DB Home enhancement

## Structure of Patch Packages

There are at least three (3) ways patches are packaged:

1. Combo package for RDBMS and OJVM patches
1. Individual packages for patches
1. GI package including RDBMS and OCW patches, but not OJVM

With this level of complexity, it is now longer easy to code for possible combinations.

## Placement of Variables for Patch Package

The variables have been moved from `install_V19C_database.yml` to `PSU19.9.yml` and `PSU19.21.yml`.

## Directory Structure for Patches

The directory structure for extracted patches is now:

* ORACLE_HOME
  * `patch`
    * `p<patch id>` # dest
      * `<patch id>` # creates

This structure is encapsulated in a list of dictionaries with the following keys:

* `creates` is a subdirectory of
* `dest`
* `src` is the name of the ZIP archive

The name of the variable containing this list of dictionaries is `patch_archives`.

## Script to do DB Patching

The script, `apply_rdbms_patches.sh`, is updated to optionally apply the OCW patch only if the `ocw_patch_id` variable is defined.

The logic for considering a combo patch is removed in favour of the simplified patch directory structure.

Also I fixed a bug in the application of the OJVM patch.

## PSU Variable Files

The PSU variable files, `PSU19.9.yml` and `PSU19.21.yml`, encapsulate the complicated logic for patching.
